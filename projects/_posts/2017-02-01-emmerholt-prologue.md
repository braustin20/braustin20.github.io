### Overview

I was the Lead Engineer for Emmerholt: Prologue, a prototype for an open world VR game. Bustling cities and towns exist there with a diverse set of factions to encounter. Unlock powerful magic which can be used at will during and outside of combat. Use the intuitive horseback riding mechanic to travel across the world.

Worked on horseback riding locomotion mechanic, player gameplay skills and abilities including motion controlled telekinesis and shield deflection, and scripted level streaming functionality for an open world map. Tasked with open-world performance optimization.
