Lowe's Anti-Theft Power Tools is a patented solution for preventing tool theft in stores.

<!--more-->

### Overview

Theft is a major problem for many retailers, and thieves typically target high value items that are easy to transport. The Anti-Theft project's focus is on preventing cordless power tools from being stolen. Our team has worked with Stanley Black & Decker to patent a unique solution involving bluetooth and IoT devices to render the tools inoperable until a valid purchase.

### Role

I was the lead engineer on this project and incorporated a wide range of technologies from Bluetooth protocols and IoT to APIs written in Python and complex analytics and monitoring solutions on slim Linux clients. I coordinated the team and designed the end-to-end flow for tool activation. It was my responsibility to ensure that the team hit deadlines and worked with teams across Lowe's to get our hardware and software deployed. I cannot go in depth until the details are made public for NDA reasons as well as not to tip off the theives.
