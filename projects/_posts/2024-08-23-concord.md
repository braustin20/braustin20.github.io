### Overview

Concord is an online multiplayer competitive shooter, where players choose from 16 characters to compete in multiple game modes on maps located on various planets. Players can create a "Crew" of 12 to bring into their matches which can include multiple "stocks" of a given character. The core gameplay revolves around playing matches, unlocking characters and their variants, unlocking cosmetics, and building your ideal Crew.

### Role
I was a Generalist Engineer on the Core Tech team at Firewalk. The Core Tech team balanced core engine work with "firefighting" and embedded with other teams who needed engineering assistance. We were relied on to quickly ramp up on codebases and mechanics to push features across the finish line. Personally, I was the engineering owner for Level Streaming, Planetary Arrival Sequence, Crew Builder, Trophies, and various dev tools. I was embedded with the UI team for half of a year, working to close out the user interface for Crew Builder, Settings, Planetary Arrival, and other unreleased features. I collaborated closely with multiple teams including Cinematics, PvE, and Gameplay Design.

The images below demonstrate some of the features I worked on. The first image is the Planetary Arrival Sequence that I scripted, including background level streaming and player synchronization.
The second image is the Crew Builder menu of which I implemented the core functionality, cloud saving, "Free Agent" system, and frontend bugfixes.
