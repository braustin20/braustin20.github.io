Word SNKE is a mobile game side project which merges classic Snake mechanics with a word puzzle game.

<!--more-->

### Overview

This project began as a “small” side endeavor to broaden my technical expertise, explore new methodologies, and refine my gameplay engineering skills. Word SNKE is a mobile game where players guide an ever-growing snake through a grid of letters to form words. The game rewards players for forming longer words and using rare letters, with increasing difficulty as the snake's growth limits access to tiles. The game features both challenge and endless modes, theme customization, and in-app monetization. Currently in the final polish stage, Word SNKE is slated for release in early 2025.

### Role

As the sole dedicated engineer on this project, I led the development of nearly all technical aspects. My contributions included:

- Gameplay Mechanics: Implemented all core features including player movement, level generation, and scoring systems
- Core Systems: Built robust systems for the word dictionary, monetization, CI/CD pipelines, and app store deployment
- Collaboration: Partnered with a UI/UX engineer for UI implementation and animation to ensure a seamless user experience

This project allowed me to push the boundaries of gameplay engineering while delivering a polished, feature-rich product.
