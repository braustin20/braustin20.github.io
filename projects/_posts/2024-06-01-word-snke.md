Word SNKE is a mobile game side project which merges classic Snake mechanics with a word puzzle game.

<!--more-->

### Overview

The goal of this project was to create a "small" side project to expand my skills, learn new techniques, and stretch my gameplay engineering skills. Word SNKE is a mobile game about guiding an ever-growing snake through a tiled board of letters to form words. Players get bonuses for word length and using rare letters, and difficulty increases as the snake grows and blocks access to tiles behind the snake head. There are challenge and endless modes, as well as theme customization and in app monetization. The app is in the final polish phase as of writing and set to release in early 2025.

### Role

I was the sole dedicated engineer on this project responsible for almost all engineering aspects of the game. I implemented all gameplay mechanics including player movement, level generation, and scoring logic. I was also responsible for all core systems including but not limited to the word dictionary, monetization, CI/CD, and app store deployment. The one engineering aspect I had help with was with UI implementation and animation.
