The Arcslinger is a VR first-person shooter for all major mobile VR platforms.

### Overview

Starting the game as a sidekick to a wild west gun slinging hero, the protagonist accidentally shoots him and therefore inherits his magical weapon with gesture activated powers.

I was in charge of the Oculus Go, PS4, and standalone headset ports as well as a prototype location-based experience. My primary tasks were performance optimization, SDK implementation, and Sony TRC compliance.  These tasks involved technical art, UI programming, level scripting, and network programming.
