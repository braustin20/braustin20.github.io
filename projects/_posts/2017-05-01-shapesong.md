Shapesong is a social music exploration experience in room-scale VR.

### Overview

In Shapesong, users join together to explore environments; find, collect, and create instruments and sounds; solve puzzles; and—of course—play music.

My role on this project is gameplay programmer as well as character artist. I modeled and animated the player avatars as well as a few other hero models including the camera drone. I also worked on a VR interaction system for the music cartridges and physics objects.
