Outer Wilds is an open-world space exploration and adventure game published by Annapurna Interactive and developed by Mobius Digital.

In Outer Wilds, players find themselves on a strange planet with 22 minutes to prevent the solar system from destroying itself.

While working at Big Red Button I was brought in to help prepare the Xbox One version for launch. My main task was to quickly get up to speed with the 6+ years worth of existing code base and integrate a long distance proxy shadow cascade system which could provide cheap dynamic shadows across the large solar system.
