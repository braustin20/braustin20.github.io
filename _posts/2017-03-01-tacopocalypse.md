Tacopocalypse is a 3D driving delivery game made in Unreal 4.

<!--more-->

This game is the first game that my studio, Cherry Pie Games, launched on Steam. Taking cues from crazy taxi and adding an apocalyptic spin, it's a unique couch co-op experience.

I was project lead and engineer in charge of gameplay programming, lighting and tech art. I provided a leadership role in development, ensuring deadlines are met and all essential components are in place. I coordinated with outside artists for the graffiti art and car skins as well as music.
