The Path is a demo for an artistic side-scrolling platform game inspired by the Legend of Sleepy Hollow.

The player must use light as their ally to fend off the beasts that lurk the forest. This demo was created in 3 weeks for pitching at E3 and has since obtained a major movie studio IP.

I was lead programmer on this project in addition to developing the spline character movement mechanics, cinematic camera and animation programming. I coordinated the junior programmers on the team and created tools and scripts for the animators and sound engineer.
